# assignment-tracker-MERN-app
 
This is a project I am working on over the summer to learn and get expierence in developing full stack applications. I plan on using a MERN(MongoDB, Expressjs, Reactjs, Nodejs) stack for this project because it is popular and I feel like learning these technologies will be very helpful in the future. The application will help users keep track of their school homework and assignments.
